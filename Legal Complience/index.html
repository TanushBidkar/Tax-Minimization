              <h2 class="heading">History Of Taxation</h2>
              <p class="para">
                It is a matter of general belief that taxes on income and wealth are of recent origin but there is enough evidence to show that taxes on income in some form or the other were levied even in primitive and ancient communities. The origin of the word "Tax" is from "Taxation" which means an estimate. These were levied either on the sale and purchase of merchandise or livestock and were collected in a haphazard manner from time to time. Nearly 2000 years ago, there went out a decree from Ceaser Augustus that all the world should be taxed. In Greece, Germany and Roman Empires, taxes were also levied sometime on the basis of turnover and sometimes on occupations. For many centuries, revenue from taxes went to the Monarch. In Northern England, taxes were levied on land and on moveable property such as the Saladin title in 1188. Later on, these were supplemented by introduction of poll taxes, and indirect taxes known as "Ancient Customs" which were duties on wool, leather and hides. These levies and taxes in various forms and on various commodities and professions were imposed to meet the needs of the Governments to meet their military and civil expenditure and not only to ensure safety to the subjects but also to meet the common needs of the citizens like maintenance of roads, administration of justice and such other functions of the State.

In India, the system of direct taxation as it is known today, has been in force in one form or another even from ancient times. There are references both in Manu Smriti and Arthasastra to a variety of tax measures. Manu, the ancient sage and law-giver stated that the king could levy taxes, according to Sastras. The wise sage advised that taxes should be related to the income and expenditure of the subject. He, however, cautioned the king against excessive taxation and stated that both extremes should be avoided namely either complete absence of taxes or exorbitant taxation. According to him, the king should arrange the collection of taxes in such a manner that the subjects did not feel the pinch of paying taxes. He laid down that traders and artisans should pay 1/5th of their profits in silver and gold, while the agriculturists were to pay 1/6th, 1/8th and 1/10th of their produce depending upon their circumstances. The detailed analysis given by Manu on the subject clearly shows the existence of a well-planned taxation system, even in ancient times. Not only this, taxes were also levied on various classes of people like actors, dancers, singers and even dancing girls. Taxes were paid in the shape of gold-coins, cattle, grains, raw-materials and also by rendering personal service.

The learned author K.B.Sarkar commends the system of taxation in ancient India in his book "Public Finance in Ancient India", (1978 Edition) as follows:-
"Most of the taxes of Ancient India were highly productive. The admixture of direct taxes with indirect Taxes secured elasticity in the tax system, although more emphasis was laid on direct tax. The tax-structure was a broad based one and covered most people within its fold. The taxes were varied and the large variety of taxes reflected the life of a large and composit population". .

              <h2 class="heading">Right To Information</h2>
              <p class="para">
                In order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of public authorities, the Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI Act 2005) empowers the citizens to have access to information under the control of public authorities.

                This website aims to provide all information that the Income Tax Department is required to publish in terms of Section 4 of the RTI Act 2005.
                
                The Income Tax Department functions under supervision and control of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT). It has around 60,000 personnel located in more than 500 cities and towns across the country. The field offices are divided into regions, and each region is headed by a Chief Commissioner of Income Tax. Every region is assigned annual performance targets, such as revenue collections, and is provided with necessary expenditure budget to meet with its operating expenses.
                
                The Income Tax Act 1961 lays down the frame work or the basis of charge and the computation of total income of a person. It also stipulates the manner in which it is to be brought to tax, defining in detail the exemptions, deductions, rebates and reliefs. The Act defines Income Tax Authorities, their jurisdiction and powers It also lays down the manner of enforcement of the Act by such authorities through an integrated process of assessments, collection and recovery, appeals and revisions, penalties and prosecutions. The Act is fast changing and dynamic in nature and undergoes amendments annually through the Finance Act.
                
                In exercise of the powers conferred by section 295 of the Income Tax Act 1961 and Rule 15 of Part A, Rule 11 of Part B and Rule 9 of Part C of the Fourth Schedule to the Act, the CBDT has notified Income Tax Rules 1962. These Rules lay down limits, conditions, definitions, explanations, and forms of applications and procedures for the uniform application of the Income Tax Act.
                
                Other direct taxes are also governed through similar arrangements. Various offices of the Income Tax department maintain technical and administrative records as specified from time to time by the CBDT. Circulars are issued from time to time by the CBDT for effective management of assessment and collection of direct taxes.
                
                The Manual of Office Procedure, in three volumes, deals with the administrative aspects, composition and organization of the Income Tax Department. The work allocation and such personnel matters as departmental examinations, confidential reports, vigilance, training and the grievance redressal mechanism. Vol II deals with technical aspects, assessment procedures, widening of tax base, central information branches, refunds, recovery, write off, interest, penalties, prosecution, appeals and revisions. Vol III deals with miscellaneous subjects such as Authority for Advance Ruling, Settlement Commission, search and seizure, internal audit, revenue audit, inspection and important reports..
